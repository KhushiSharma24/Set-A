/*  A professor attended a party and classified it into two categories based on the colors of the robes. If all persons at the party are wearing different colored robes, 
represented by positive integers in the array arr[] of size n, then it is a girl's only party. If there is at least one duplicate color, it is a boy's party.
Determine the type of party by returning “BOYS” if it’s a boy’s party, otherwise return “GIRLS”.

Examples:
Input
n = 5, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
Output
GIRLS
Explanation:
All the colors are unique so it's a GIRLS party.
Input
n = 6, arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1}
Output
BOYS
Explanation:
There are two colors 1. So it's a BOYS party.     */
